Gerbv -- a Gerber file viewer

Gerbv is part of the gEDA Project
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- About gerbv

  *  Gerbv is a viewer for Gerber RS-274X files, Excellon drill files, and CSV
     pick-and-place files.  (Note:  RS-274D files are not supported.)
  *  Gerbv is a native Linux application, and it runs on many common unix
     platforms.
  *  Gerbv is free/ open-source software.
  *  The core functionality of gerbv is located in a separate library
     (libgerbv), allowing developers to include Gerber
     parsing/editing/exporting/rendering into other programs.
  *  Gerbv is one of the utilities affiliated with the gEDA project, an
     umbrella organization dedicated to producing free software tools for
     electronic design. 

-- Building gerbv by downloading a release tarball

   1. Download source tarballs from http://gerbv.sourceforge.net.
   2. Expand source by running gzip -dc <filename> | tar xf -
   3. Change to newly expanded directory
   4. Type ./configure <switches>.
      The following (gerbv) switches are available to configure:
          * --help: Lists all configure options.
          * --enable-debug: Program will output lots of debug 
              spew while running. (default = no -> no debug output 
              by default.)
          * --enable-unit-mm: Set default unit for coordinates in 
              status bar to mm (default = no -> units = inches 
              by default.)
          * --enable-efence: Link with ElectricFence for malloc 
              debugging (default = no -> efence off by default.)
          * --disable-update-desktop-database: Update desktop icon 
              database after installation (default = no -> desktop 
              icon installed by default.)
   5. Type make
   6. Type make install. Please note that if you want to install 
      it in a system directory you have to su first.
   7. Test by typing gerbv 

-- Building gerbv by downloading from anonymous CVS

   1. Login to anonymous CVS (only needed the first time):
      cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@gerbv.cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/gerbv login .
      Press Enter when CVS asks for a password.
   2. Check out the source tree:
      cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anonymous@gerbv.cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/gerbv co gerbv
   3. Recreate all build system files:
      sh autogen.sh
   4. Type ./configure <switches>.
      The following (gerbv) switches are available to configure:
          * --help: Lists all configure options.
          * --enable-debug: Program will output lots of debug 
              spew while running. (default = no -> no debug output 
              by default.)
          * --enable-unit-mm: Set default unit for coordinates in 
              status bar to mm (default = no -> units = inches 
              by default.)
          * --enable-efence: Link with ElectricFence for malloc 
              debugging (default = no -> efence off by default.)
          * --disable-update-desktop-database: Update desktop icon 
              database after installation (default = no -> desktop 
              icon installed by default.)
   5. Type make
   6. Type make install. Please note that if you want to install 
      it in a system directory you have to su first.
   7. Test by typing gerbv 
   8. Run cvs update in the checked out gerbv directory to get 
      the latest changes.
