- check for shorts
  - Typical problem areas
  - Processor pins

    Fix:
    - use fine soldering iron to wick solder bridge away from
      processor pins along the trace. This is easiest with some flux 
      to help the solder flow. Flux the trace and the solder will follow.

    - If there is a lot of excess solder a solder sucker or copper wick 
      may be usefull.

  - LCD pads

    Fix:
    - use fine or normal soldering iron to wick solder down along trace
      flux the traces and the solder will follow
    - can also melt and carefully flick a blob off the board

    - If there is a lot of excess solder a solder sucker or copper wick 
      may be usefull.

- check for capacitors that "submarine" or "tombstone" this is where the 
  part tilts up during the reflow process instead of staying flat

  Fix:

  - Hot air station is recommended
    *** Try not to heat and blow away nearby parts ***
    - Hold part with a tweezer while pointing the air towards the part
      and moving maybe 1/4 - 1/2" circles around it, this is to avoid heating 
      to long in one spot and cooking the board or the part. 
      1 minute should do it. Temps are 6 or 700F and air flow is 4 or 5 out of 10.

  - Solder iron
    - DONT PRY ON THE PART -SERIOUSLY- the traces tear very easily when hot
    - Heat up the part by applying heat alternating on each end and the middle
      You can also use the side of the iron tip (not the point) to apply heat
      After a minute or two the part will either stick to the iron or one end 
      will come loose, then the other end can be desoldered while the part is 
      held with a tweezer
  
- Check for capacitors and other parts that have moved off position. 
  The resistors and other parts do not typically have this problem 

- USB soldering
  *make sure the usb hangs over the edge of the board and fits flush against it*
  - flatten and bend big side pins out to the side above the plane of the PCB 
    board
  - cut 2 plastic alignment pin from under connector
  - solder 4 small USB pins 
  - check that the part is still flush against the board
  - bend down big side pins
  - solder big side pins. These take a lot of heat. Flux is also recommended.
    *** Using the sharp point of the iron is useless ***
    *** as that won't transfer much heat at all ***
    If you have a chisel tip available for your iron, now is the time to use it.
    Put a big blob of solder on the iron and apply to pin using the side/edge of 
    the tip to contact the pin to transfer the most heat. 
    

 - IR LED
 - "L" bend leads, cut maybe 1/4 - 1/2" long
 - Dot faces left

 - IR Receiver
 - "L" bend leads, cut maybe 1/4 - 3/8" long
 - Curved dome faces left

 - Piezo
   - "L" bend leads, medium length maybe 1/2
   - Piezo point towards USB so it doesn't cover hackrva logo

 - 32768 clock crystal 
   - cut leads to about 1/4" so it doesnt reach the ground line when lying almost 
     flat
   - part should not touch capactors, it should be between them
